                                        <p>There were three round cakes cooling on the countertop. The excitement in the house was all centered around that smell. I grew up in a home of 6 people, and we didn't have much. But every birthday, there was always the treat of cake. I remember thinking of cake as this magical thing that could bring quarreling people together, even just for an afternoon. I wanted to give that magic to everyone I could, so I began baking. Over the years I have experimented with ingredients and believe I have discovered some truly delicious cakes! Now I want to share those with you. Share the magic that I was mesmorized by as a child. Find your bake, and I will make the magic happen!</p>
